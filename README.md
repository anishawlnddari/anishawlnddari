**anishawlnddari/anishawlnddari** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently study on UMM Malang 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about basic coding first Hehehe
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: on my Instagram DM
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can cook, I can do makeup, I can clean, I can do anything, however, coding is stressful to learn, but it has to be learned! Hwaiting
